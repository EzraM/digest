# Digest
## Web browser built on a notebook

Digest is an early prototype of a web browser built on a notebook.

We can probably do better than tabs in our browsers. For most of us, our tabs end up as favicons in a heap.

The idea of Digest is that tabs do a lot of things.
They serve as a todo list.
A form of memory.
They are the gate to doing things on the web.
We have a lot of tabs because we use them for thinking.
And one of the best tools we have for thinking is words on a page.

So, in a notebook, the pages we are interested in can be next to short notes. They can live under headings. They can have images or clips from pages.

The way we open a page from the notebook is from... a link,

Links, the heroic little words that made the web a special place back in the CERN days, when Tim Berners-Lee put anchor tags in the first version of HTML.

Digest is about going back to technology that allowed the web to scale, links, and using it to make our browsers scale better for us.
